For example `account=E-1234-5678-ABCD-EFGH`, `state=pending_cancellation`, and `plan!=foo-plan`. Supported query attributes are * `account` * `customer_billing_account` with value in the format of: `billingAccounts/{id}` * `product_external_name` * `quote_external_name` * `offer` * `new_pending_offer` * `plan` * `newPendingPlan` or `new_pending_plan` * `state` * `services` * `consumers.project` * `change_history.new_offer` Note that the consumers and change_history.new_offer match works on repeated structures, so equality (`consumers.project=projects/123456789`) is not supported. Set membership can be expressed with the `:` operator. For example, `consumers.project:projects/123456789` finds entitlements with at least one consumer with project field equal to `projects/123456789`. `change_history.new_offer` retrieves all entitlements that were once associated or are currently active with the offer. Also note that the state name match is case-insensitive and query can omit the prefix "ENTITLEMENT_". For example, `state=active` is equivalent to `state=ENTITLEMENT_ACTIVE`. If the query contains some special characters other than letters, underscore, or digits, the phrase must be quoted with double quotes. For example, `product="providerId:productId"`, where the product name needs to be quoted because it contains special character colon. Queries can be combined with `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` to form more complex queries. They can also be grouped to force a desired evaluation order. For example, `state=active AND (account=E-1234 OR account=5678) AND NOT (product=foo-product)`. Connective `AND` can be omitted between two predicates. For example `account=E-1234 state=active` is equivalent to `account=E-1234 AND state=active`. */
