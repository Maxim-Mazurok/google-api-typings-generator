             * `projects/*‍/locations/*‍/catalogs/*‍/branches/default_branch` is equivalent to setting SearchRequest.branch to `projects/*‍/locations/*‍/catalogs/*‍/branches/1`. Using multiple

             * this API while keeping using `projects/*‍/locations/*‍/catalogs/*‍/branches/default_branch` as SearchRequest.branch to route the traffic to this staging branch. CAUTION: If you have

             * PredictionService will only return product IDs from branch {newBranch}. * SearchService will only return product IDs from branch {newBranch} (if branch is not explicitly set). *
