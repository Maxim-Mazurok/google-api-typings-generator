# TypeScript typings for Google Cloud Data Catalog API v1beta1

A fully managed and highly scalable data discovery and metadata management service.

For detailed description please check [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/data-catalog/docs/).

## Installing

Install typings for Google Cloud Data Catalog API:

```
npm install @types/gapi.client.datacatalog@v1beta1 --save-dev
```

## Usage

You need to initialize Google API client in your code:

```typescript
gapi.load('client', () => {
  // now we can use gapi.client
  // ...
});
```

Then load api client wrapper:

```typescript
gapi.client.load('datacatalog', 'v1beta1', () => {
  // now we can use gapi.client.datacatalog
  // ...
});
```

Don't forget to authenticate your client before sending any request to resources:

```typescript
// declare client_id registered in Google Developers Console
var client_id = '',
  scope = [ 
      // View and manage your data across Google Cloud Platform services
      'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform',
    ],
    immediate = true;
// ...

gapi.auth.authorize(
  { client_id: client_id, scope: scope, immediate: immediate },
  authResult => {
    if (authResult && !authResult.error) {
        /* handle successful authorization */
    } else {
        /* handle authorization error */
    }
});
```

After that you can use Google Cloud Data Catalog API resources:

```typescript

/*
Searches Data Catalog for multiple resources like entries, tags that
match a query.

This is a custom method
(https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/custom_methods) and does not return
the complete resource, only the resource identifier and high level
fields. Clients can subsequentally call `Get` methods.

Note that Data Catalog search queries do not guarantee full recall. Query
results that match your query may not be returned, even in subsequent
result pages. Also note that results returned (and not returned) can vary
across repeated search queries.

See [Data Catalog Search
Syntax](https://cloud.google.com/data-catalog/docs/how-to/search-reference)
for more information.
*/
await gapi.client.datacatalog.catalog.search({  });

/*
Get an entry by target resource name. This method allows clients to use
the resource name from the source Google Cloud Platform service to get the
Data Catalog Entry.
*/
await gapi.client.datacatalog.entries.lookup({  });
```
