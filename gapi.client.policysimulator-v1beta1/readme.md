# TypeScript typings for Policy Simulator API v1beta1

 Policy Simulator is a collection of endpoints for creating, running, and viewing a Replay. A `Replay` is a type of simulation that lets you see how your members' access to resources might change if you changed your IAM policy. During a `Replay`, Policy Simulator re-evaluates, or replays, past access attempts under both the current policy and your proposed policy, and compares those results to determine how your members' access might change under the proposed policy.
For detailed description please check [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/simulating-access).

## Installing

Install typings for Policy Simulator API:

```
npm install @types/gapi.client.policysimulator-v1beta1 --save-dev
```

## Usage

You need to initialize Google API client in your code:

```typescript
gapi.load('client', () => {
  // now we can use gapi.client
  // ...
});
```

Then load api client wrapper:

```typescript
gapi.client.load('https://policysimulator.googleapis.com/$discovery/rest?version=v1beta1', () => {
  // now we can use:
  // gapi.client.policysimulator
});
```

```typescript
// Deprecated, use discovery document URL, see https://github.com/google/google-api-javascript-client/blob/master/docs/reference.md#----gapiclientloadname----version----callback--
gapi.client.load('policysimulator', 'v1beta1', () => {
  // now we can use:
  // gapi.client.policysimulator
});
```

Don't forget to authenticate your client before sending any request to resources:

```typescript
// declare client_id registered in Google Developers Console
var client_id = '',
  scope = [
      // See, edit, configure, and delete your Google Cloud data and see the email address for your Google Account.
      'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform',
    ],
    immediate = true;
// ...

gapi.auth.authorize(
  { client_id: client_id, scope: scope, immediate: immediate },
  authResult => {
    if (authResult && !authResult.error) {
        /* handle successful authorization */
    } else {
        /* handle authorization error */
    }
});
```

After that you can use Policy Simulator API resources: <!-- TODO: make this work for multiple namespaces -->

```typescript

/*
Gets the latest state of a long-running operation. Clients can use this method to poll the operation result at intervals as recommended by the API service.
*/
await gapi.client.policysimulator.operations.get({ name: "name",  });

/*
Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `UNIMPLEMENTED`. NOTE: the `name` binding allows API services to override the binding to use different resource name schemes, such as `users/*/operations`. To override the binding, API services can add a binding such as `"/v1/{name=users/*}/operations"` to their service configuration. For backwards compatibility, the default name includes the operations collection id, however overriding users must ensure the name binding is the parent resource, without the operations collection id.
*/
await gapi.client.policysimulator.operations.list({  });
```
