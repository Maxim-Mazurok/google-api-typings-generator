                 * `maxDuration` - `approvalStatus` - `exchangeReviewStatus` - `dynamic` - `creativeId` * The operator must be `HAS (:)` for the following fields: - `lineItemIds` * The operator
                 * must be `GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO (>=)` or `LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO (<=)` for the following fields: - `updateTime` (input in ISO 8601 format, or YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ) * For
                 * `entityStatus`, `minDuration`, `maxDuration`, `updateTime`, and `dynamic`, there may be at most one restriction. * For `dimensions`, the value is in the form of
                 * `"{width}x{height}"`. * For `exchangeReviewStatus`, the value is in the form of `{exchange}-{reviewStatus}`. * For `minDuration` and `maxDuration`, the value is in the form of
                 * `"{duration}s"`. Only seconds are supported with millisecond granularity. * For `updateTime`, a creative resource's field value reflects the last time that a creative has been
                 * updated, which includes updates made by the system (e.g. creative review updates). * There may be multiple `lineItemIds` restrictions in order to search against multiple
                 * possible line item IDs. * There may be multiple `creativeId` restrictions in order to search against multiple possible creative IDs. Examples: * All native creatives:
                 * `creativeType="CREATIVE_TYPE_NATIVE"` * All active creatives with 300x400 or 50x100 dimensions: `entityStatus="ENTITY_STATUS_ACTIVE" AND (dimensions="300x400" OR
                 * dimensions="50x100")` * All dynamic creatives that are approved by AdX or AppNexus, with a minimum duration of 5 seconds and 200ms. `dynamic="true" AND minDuration="5.2s" AND
                 * (exchangeReviewStatus="EXCHANGE_GOOGLE_AD_MANAGER-REVIEW_STATUS_APPROVED" OR exchangeReviewStatus="EXCHANGE_APPNEXUS-REVIEW_STATUS_APPROVED")` * All video creatives that are
                 * associated with line item ID 1 or 2: `creativeType="CREATIVE_TYPE_VIDEO" AND (lineItemIds:1 OR lineItemIds:2)` * Find creatives by multiple creative IDs: `creativeId=1 OR
                 * creativeId=2` * All creatives with an update time greater than or equal to `2020-11-04T18:54:47Z (format of ISO 8601)`: `updateTime>="2020-11-04T18:54:47Z"` The length of this
