# TypeScript typings for Service Control API v2

Provides control plane functionality to managed services, such as logging, monitoring, and status checks.
For detailed description please check [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/service-control/).

## Installing

Install typings for Service Control API:

```
npm install @types/gapi.client.servicecontrol@v2 --save-dev
```

## Usage

You need to initialize Google API client in your code:

```typescript
gapi.load('client', () => {
  // now we can use gapi.client
  // ...
});
```

Then load api client wrapper:

```typescript
gapi.client.load('servicecontrol', 'v2', () => {
  // now we can use gapi.client.servicecontrol
  // ...
});
```

Don't forget to authenticate your client before sending any request to resources:

```typescript
// declare client_id registered in Google Developers Console
var client_id = '',
  scope = [ 
      // View and manage your data across Google Cloud Platform services
      'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform',

      // Manage your Google Service Control data
      'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/servicecontrol',
    ],
    immediate = true;
// ...

gapi.auth.authorize(
  { client_id: client_id, scope: scope, immediate: immediate },
  authResult => {
    if (authResult && !authResult.error) {
        /* handle successful authorization */
    } else {
        /* handle authorization error */
    }
});
```

After that you can use Service Control API resources:

```typescript

/*
Private Preview. This feature is only available for approved services. This method provides admission control for services that are integrated with [Service Infrastructure](/service-infrastructure). It checks whether an operation should be allowed based on the service configuration and relevant policies. It must be called before the operation is executed. For more information, see [Admission Control](/service-infrastructure/docs/admission-control). NOTE: The admission control has an expected policy propagation delay of 60s. The caller **must** not depend on the most recent policy changes. NOTE: The admission control has a hard limit of 1 referenced resources per call. If an operation refers to more than 1 resources, the caller must call the Check method multiple times. This method requires the `servicemanagement.services.check` permission on the specified service. For more information, see [Service Control API Access Control](https://cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure/docs/service-control/access-control).
*/
await gapi.client.servicecontrol.services.check({ serviceName: "serviceName",  });

/*
Private Preview. This feature is only available for approved services. This method provides telemetry reporting for services that are integrated with [Service Infrastructure](/service-infrastructure). It reports a list of operations that have occurred on a service. It must be called after the operations have been executed. For more information, see [Telemetry Reporting](/service-infrastructure/docs/telemetry-reporting). NOTE: The telemetry reporting has a hard limit of 1000 operations and 1MB per Report call. It is recommended to have no more than 100 operations per call. This method requires the `servicemanagement.services.report` permission on the specified service. For more information, see [Service Control API Access Control](https://cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure/docs/service-control/access-control).
*/
await gapi.client.servicecontrol.services.report({ serviceName: "serviceName",  });
```
