NOTE: capping a reservation's idle slot usage is best effort and its usage may exceed the max_slots value. However, in terms of autoscale.current_slots (which accounts for the additional added slots), it will never exceed the max_slots - baseline. This field must be set together with the scaling_mode enum value, otherwise the request will be rejected with error code `google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT`.

If the max_slots is 1000, scaling_mode is IDLE_SLOTS_ONLY, then in the output, the autoscaler field will be null. If the max_slots and scaling_mode are set, then the ignore_idle_slots field must be aligned with the scaling_mode enum value.(See details in ScalingMode comments). Otherwise the request will be rejected with error code `google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT`. Please note, the max_slots is for user to manage the part of slots greater than the baseline. Therefore, we don't allow users to set max_slots smaller or equal to the baseline as it will not be meaningful. If the field is present and slot_capacity>=max_slots, requests will be rejected with error code `google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT`. Please note that if max_slots is set to 0, we will treat it as unset. Customers can set max_slots to 0 and set scaling_mode to SCALING_MODE_UNSPECIFIED to disable the max_slots feature. */

Currently a resource (project, folder, organization) can only have one assignment per each (job_type, location) combination, and that reservation will be used for all jobs of the matching type. Different assignments can be created on different levels of the projects, folders or organization hierarchy. During query execution, the assignment is looked up at the project, folder and organization levels in that order. The first assignment found is applied to the query. When creating assignments, it does not matter if other assignments exist at higher levels. Example: * The organization `organizationA` contains two projects, `project1` and `project2`. * Assignments for all three entities (`organizationA`, `project1`, and `project2`) could all be created and mapped to the same or different reservations. "None" assignments represent an absence of the assignment. Projects assigned to None use on-demand pricing. To create a "None" assignment, use "none" as a reservation_id in the parent. Example parent: `projects/myproject/locations/US/reservations/none`. Returns `google.rpc.Code.PERMISSION_DENIED` if user does not have 'bigquery.admin' permissions on the project using the reservation and the project that owns this reservation. Returns `google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT` when location of the assignment does not match location of the reservation. */
