# TypeScript typings for Genomics API v1

Uploads, processes, queries, and searches Genomics data in the cloud.
For detailed description please check [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/genomics).

## Installing

Install typings for Genomics API:

```
npm install @types/gapi.client.genomics@v1 --save-dev
```

## Usage

You need to initialize Google API client in your code:

```typescript
gapi.load('client', () => {
  // now we can use gapi.client
  // ...
});
```

Then load api client wrapper:

```typescript
gapi.client.load('genomics', 'v1', () => {
  // now we can use gapi.client.genomics
  // ...
});
```

Don't forget to authenticate your client before sending any request to resources:

```typescript
// declare client_id registered in Google Developers Console
var client_id = '',
  scope = [ 
      // See, edit, configure, and delete your Google Cloud Platform data
      'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform',

      // View and manage Genomics data
      'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/genomics',
    ],
    immediate = true;
// ...

gapi.auth.authorize(
  { client_id: client_id, scope: scope, immediate: immediate },
  authResult => {
    if (authResult && !authResult.error) {
        /* handle successful authorization */
    } else {
        /* handle authorization error */
    }
});
```

After that you can use Genomics API resources:

```typescript

/*
Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not guaranteed. Clients may use Operations.GetOperation or Operations.ListOperations to check whether the cancellation succeeded or the operation completed despite cancellation. Authorization requires the following [Google IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam) permission: * `genomics.operations.cancel`
*/
await gapi.client.genomics.operations.cancel({ name: "name",  });

/*
Gets the latest state of a long-running operation. Clients can use this method to poll the operation result at intervals as recommended by the API service. Authorization requires the following [Google IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam) permission: * `genomics.operations.get`
*/
await gapi.client.genomics.operations.get({ name: "name",  });

/*
Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request. Authorization requires the following [Google IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam) permission: * `genomics.operations.list`
*/
await gapi.client.genomics.operations.list({ name: "name",  });
```
