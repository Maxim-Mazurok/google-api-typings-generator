         * preconditions for an action. For example, a client may want to know if it is OK to send a web URL to a particular mobile app instead. The client can check for the relevant asset link
         * from the website to the mobile app to decide if the operation should be allowed. A note about security: if you specify a secure asset as the source, such as an HTTPS website or an
         * Android app, the API will ensure that any statements used to generate the response have been made in a secure way by the owner of that asset. Conversely, if the source asset is an
         * insecure HTTP website (that is, the URL starts with `http://` instead of `https://`), the API cannot verify its statements securely, and it is not possible to ensure that the website's
         * statements have not been altered by a third party. For more information, see the [Digital Asset Links technical design
         * specification](https://github.com/google/digitalassetlinks/blob/master/well-known/details.md).
