For example, if you filter by new reactions (`google.workspace.chat.reaction.v1.created`), the server also returns batch new reactions events (`google.workspace.chat.reaction.v1.batchCreated`). For a list of supported event types, see the [`SpaceEvents` reference documentation](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/spaces.spaceEvents#SpaceEvent.FIELDS.event_type).

For an example, see [Set up a space with initial members](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/set-up-spaces). To specify the human members to add, add memberships with the appropriate `membership.member.name`. To add a human user, use `users/{user}`, where `{user}` can be the email address for the user. For users in the same Workspace organization `{user}` can also be the `id` for the person from the People API, or the `id` for the user in the Directory API. For example, if the People API Person profile ID for `user@example.com` is `123456789`, you can add the user to the space by setting the `membership.member.name` to `users/user@example.com` or `users/123456789`. To specify the Google groups to add, add memberships with the appropriate `membership.group_member.name`. To add or invite a Google group, use `groups/{group}`, where `{group}` is the `id` for the group from the Cloud Identity Groups API. For example, you can use [Cloud Identity Groups lookup API](https://cloud.google.com/identity/docs/reference/rest/v1/groups/lookup) to retrieve the ID `123456789` for group email `group@example.com`, then you can add the group to the space by setting the `membership.group_member.name` to `groups/123456789`. Group email is not supported, and Google groups can only be added as members in named spaces. For a named space or group chat, if the caller blocks, or is blocked by some members, or doesn't have permission to add some members, then those members aren't added to the created space. To create a direct message (DM) between the calling user and another human user, specify exactly one membership to represent the human user. If one user blocks the other, the request fails and the DM isn't created. To create a DM between the calling user and the calling app, set `Space.singleUserBotDm` to `true` and don't specify any memberships. You can only use this method to set up a DM with the calling app. To add the calling app as a member of a space or an existing DM between two human users, see [Invite or add a user or app to a space](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/create-members). If a DM already exists between two users, even when one user blocks the other at the time a request is made, then the existing DM is returned. Spaces with threaded replies aren't supported. If you receive the error message `ALREADY_EXISTS` when setting up a space, try a different `displayName`. An existing space within the Google Workspace organization might already use this display name.
