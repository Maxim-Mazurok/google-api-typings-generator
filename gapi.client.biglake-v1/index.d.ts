Does not include identities that come from external identity providers (IdPs) through identity federation. * `user:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a specific Google account. For example, `alice@example.com` . * `serviceAccount:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a Google service account. For example, `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`. * `serviceAccount:{projectid}.svc.id.goog[{namespace}/{kubernetes-sa}]`: An identifier for a [Kubernetes service account](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/kubernetes-service-accounts). For example, `my-project.svc.id.goog[my-namespace/my-kubernetes-sa]`. * `group:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a Google group. For example, `admins@example.com`. * `domain:{domain}`: The G Suite domain (primary) that represents all the users of that domain.
