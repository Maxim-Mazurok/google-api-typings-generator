# TypeScript typings for Travel Impact Model API v1

Travel Impact Model API lets you query travel carbon emission estimates.
For detailed description please check [documentation](https://developers.google.com/travel/impact-model).

## Installing

Install typings for Travel Impact Model API:

```
npm install @types/gapi.client.travelimpactmodel-v1 --save-dev
```

## Usage

You need to initialize Google API client in your code:

```typescript
gapi.load('client', () => {
  // now we can use gapi.client
  // ...
});
```

Then load api client wrapper:

```typescript
gapi.client.load(
  'https://travelimpactmodel.googleapis.com/$discovery/rest?version=v1',
  () => {
    // now we can use:
    // gapi.client.travelimpactmodel
  },
);
```

```typescript
// Deprecated, use discovery document URL, see https://github.com/google/google-api-javascript-client/blob/master/docs/reference.md#----gapiclientloadname----version----callback--
gapi.client.load('travelimpactmodel', 'v1', () => {
  // now we can use:
  // gapi.client.travelimpactmodel
});
```

After that you can use Travel Impact Model API resources: <!-- TODO: make this work for multiple namespaces -->

```typescript
/*
Stateless method to retrieve emission estimates. Details on how emission estimates are computed: https://github.com/google/travel-impact-model The response will contain all entries that match the input flight legs, in the same order. If there are no estimates available for a certain flight leg, the response will return the flight leg object with empty emission fields. The request will still be considered successful. Reasons for missing emission estimates include: * The flight is unknown to the server. * The input flight leg is missing one or more identifiers. * The flight date is in the past. * The aircraft type is not supported by the model. * Missing seat configuration. The request can contain up to 1000 flight legs. If the request has more than 1000 direct flights, if will fail with an INVALID_ARGUMENT error.
*/
await gapi.client.travelimpactmodel.flights.computeFlightEmissions({});

/*
Retrieves typical flight emissions estimates between two airports, also known as a market. If there are no estimates available for a certain market, the response will return the market object with empty emission fields. The request will still be considered successful. Details on how the typical emissions estimates are computed are on [GitHub](https://github.com/google/travel-impact-model/blob/main/projects/typical_flight_emissions.md). The request can contain up to 1000 markets. If the request has more than 1000 markets, it will fail with an INVALID_ARGUMENT error.
