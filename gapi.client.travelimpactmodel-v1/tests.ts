         * The request will still be considered successful. Reasons for missing emission estimates include: - The flight is unknown to the server. - The input flight leg is missing one or more
         * identifiers. - The flight date is in the past. - The aircraft type is not supported by the model. - Missing seat configuration. The request can contain up to 1000 flight legs. If the
         * request has more than 1000 direct flights, if will fail with an INVALID_ARGUMENT error.
