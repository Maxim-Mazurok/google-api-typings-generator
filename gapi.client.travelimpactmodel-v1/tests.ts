    /** Stateless method to retrieve GHG emissions estimates for a set of flight segments for Scope 3 reporting. The response will contain all entries that match the input Scope3FlightSegment flight segments, in the same order provided. The estimates will be computed using the following cascading logic (using the first one that is available): 1. TIM-based emissions given origin, destination, carrier, flightNumber, departureDate, and cabinClass. 2. Typical flight emissions given origin, destination, year in departureDate, and cabinClass. 3. Distance-based emissions calculated using distanceKm, year in departureDate, and cabinClass. If there is a future flight requested in this calendar year, we do not support Tier 1 emissions and will fallback to Tier 2 or 3 emissions. If the requested future flight is in not in this calendar year, we will return an empty response. We recommend that for future flights, computeFlightEmissions API is used instead. If there are no estimates available for a certain flight with any of the three methods, the response will return a Scope3FlightEmissions object with empty emission fields. The request will still be considered successful. Generally, missing emissions estimates occur when the flight is unknown to the server (e.g. no specific flight exists, or typical flight emissions are not available for the requested pair). The request will fail with an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error if: * The request contains more than 1,000 flight legs. * The input flight leg is missing one or more identifiers. For example, missing origin/destination without a valid distance for TIM_EMISSIONS or TYPICAL_FLIGHT_EMISSIONS type matching, or missing distance for a DISTANCE_BASED_EMISSIONS type matching (if you want to fallback to distance-based emissions or want a distance-based emissions estimate, you need to specify a distance). * The flight date is before 2019 (Scope 3 data is only available for 2019 and after). * The flight distance is 0 or lower. * Missing cabin class. Because the request is processed with fallback logic, it is possible that misconfigured requests return valid emissions estimates using fallback methods. For example, if a request has the wrong flight number but specifies the origin and destination, the request will still succeed, but the returned emissions will be based solely on the typical flight emissions. Similarly, if a request is missing the origin for a typical flight emissions request, but specifies a valid distance, the request could succeed based solely on the distance-based emissions. Consequently, one should check the source of the returned emissions (source) to confirm the results are as expected. */
