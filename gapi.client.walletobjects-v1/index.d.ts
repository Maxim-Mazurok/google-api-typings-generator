If the date/time is intended for a physical location in New York, this would be the equivalent of Eastern Daylight Time (EDT). Remember that offset varies in regions that observe Daylight Saving Time (or Summer Time), depending on the time of the year. `1985-04-12T19:20:50.52` would be 20 minutes and 50.52 seconds after the 19th hour of April 12th, 1985 with no offset information.

For example, a time of `2018-06-19T18:30:00-04:00` will be 18:30:00 for a user in New York and 15:30:00 for a user in Los Angeles. Omitting the offset makes this a local date/time, representing several instants in time around the world. The date/time will always be in the user's current time zone. For example, a time of `2018-06-19T18:30:00` will be 18:30:00 for a user in New York and also 18:30:00 for a user in Los Angeles.
