A higher pCTR suggests that the result is more likely to satisfy the user's query and intent, making it a valuable signal for ranking. * `freshness_rank`: freshness adjustment as a rank * `document_age`: The time in hours elapsed since the document was last updated, a floating-point number (e.g., 0.25 means 15 minutes). * `topicality_rank`: topicality adjustment as a rank.

A higher pCTR suggests that the result is more likely to satisfy the user's query and intent, making it a valuable signal for ranking. * `freshness_rank`: freshness adjustment as a rank * `document_age`: The time in hours elapsed since the document was last updated, a floating-point number (e.g., 0.25 means 15 minutes). * `topicality_rank`: topicality adjustment as a rank.

If ranking_expression_backend is not provided or set to `RANK_BY_EMBEDDING`, it should be a single function or multiple functions that are joined by "+". * ranking_expression = function, { " + ", function }; Supported functions: * double * relevance_score * double * dotProduct(embedding_field_path) Function variables: * `relevance_score`: pre-defined keywords, used for measure relevance between query and document. * `embedding_field_path`: the document embedding field used with query embedding vector. * `dotProduct`: embedding function between `embedding_field_path` and query embedding vector. Example ranking expression: If document has an embedding field doc_embedding, the ranking expression could be `0.5 * relevance_score + 0.3 * dotProduct(doc_embedding)`. If ranking_expression_backend is set to `RANK_BY_FORMULA`, the following expression types (and combinations of those chained using + or * operators) are supported: * `double` * `signal` * `log(signal)` * `exp(signal)` * `rr(signal, double > 0)` -- reciprocal rank transformation with second argument being a denominator constant. * `is_nan(signal)` -- returns 0 if signal is NaN, 1 otherwise. * `fill_nan(signal1, signal2 | double)` -- if signal1 is NaN, returns signal2 | double, else returns signal1. Here are a few examples of ranking formulas that use the supported ranking expression types: - `0.2 * semantic_similarity_score + 0.8 * log(keyword_similarity_score)` -- mostly rank by the logarithm of `keyword_similarity_score` with slight `semantic_smilarity_score` adjustment. - `0.2 * exp(fill_nan(semantic_similarity_score, 0)) + 0.3 * is_nan(keyword_similarity_score)` -- rank by the exponent of `semantic_similarity_score` filling the value with 0 if it's NaN, also add constant 0.3 adjustment to the final score if `semantic_similarity_score` is NaN. - `0.2 * rr(semantic_similarity_score, 16) + 0.8 * rr(keyword_similarity_score, 16)` -- mostly rank by the reciprocal rank of `keyword_similarity_score` with slight adjustment of reciprocal rank of `semantic_smilarity_score`. The following signals are supported: * `semantic_similarity_score`: semantic similarity adjustment that is calculated using the embeddings generated by a proprietary Google model. This score determines how semantically similar a search query is to a document. * `keyword_similarity_score`: keyword match adjustment uses the Best Match 25 (BM25) ranking function. This score is calculated using a probabilistic model to estimate the probability that a document is relevant to a given query. * `relevance_score`: semantic relevance adjustment that uses a proprietary Google model to determine the meaning and intent behind a user's query in context with the content in the documents. * `pctr_rank`: predicted conversion rate adjustment as a rank use predicted Click-through rate (pCTR) to gauge the relevance and attractiveness of a search result from a user's perspective. A higher pCTR suggests that the result is more likely to satisfy the user's query and intent, making it a valuable signal for ranking. * `freshness_rank`: freshness adjustment as a rank * `document_age`: The time in hours elapsed since the document was last updated, a floating-point number (e.g., 0.25 means 15 minutes). * `topicality_rank`: topicality adjustment as a rank. Uses proprietary Google model to determine the keyword-based overlap between the query and the document. * `base_rank`: the default rank of the result */
