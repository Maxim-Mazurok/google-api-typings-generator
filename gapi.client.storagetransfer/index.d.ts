             * operation, the currently running transfer is interrupted. For recurring transfer jobs, the next instance of the transfer job will still run. For example, if your job is configured
             * to run every day at 1pm and you cancel Monday's operation at 1:05pm, Monday's transfer will stop. However, a transfer job will still be attempted on Tuesday. This applies only to
             * currently running operations. If an operation is not currently running, `cancel` does nothing. *Caution:* Canceling a transfer job can leave your data in an unknown state. We
             * recommend that you restore the state at both the destination and the source after the `cancel` request completes so that your data is in a consistent state. When you cancel a job,
             * the next job computes a delta of files and may repair any inconsistent state. For instance, if you run a job every day, and today's job found 10 new files and transferred five files
             * before you canceled the job, tomorrow's transfer operation will compute a new delta with the five files that were not copied today plus any new files discovered tomorrow.
