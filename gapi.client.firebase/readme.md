# TypeScript typings for Firebase Management API v1beta1

The Firebase Management API enables programmatic setup and management of Firebase projects, including a project's Firebase resources and Firebase apps.
For detailed description please check [documentation](https://firebase.google.com).

## Installing

Install typings for Firebase Management API:

```
npm install @types/gapi.client.firebase@v1beta1 --save-dev
```

## Usage

You need to initialize Google API client in your code:

```typescript
gapi.load('client', () => {
  // now we can use gapi.client
  // ...
});
```

Then load api client wrapper:

```typescript
gapi.client.load('firebase', 'v1beta1', () => {
  // now we can use gapi.client.firebase
  // ...
});
```

Don't forget to authenticate your client before sending any request to resources:

```typescript
// declare client_id registered in Google Developers Console
var client_id = '',
  scope = [ 
      // See, edit, configure, and delete your Google Cloud Platform data
      'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform',

      // View your data across Google Cloud Platform services
      'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform.read-only',

      // View and administer all your Firebase data and settings
      'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/firebase',

      // View all your Firebase data and settings
      'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/firebase.readonly',
    ],
    immediate = true;
// ...

gapi.auth.authorize(
  { client_id: client_id, scope: scope, immediate: immediate },
  authResult => {
    if (authResult && !authResult.error) {
        /* handle successful authorization */
    } else {
        /* handle authorization error */
    }
});
```

After that you can use Firebase Management API resources:

```typescript

/*
Lists each [Google Cloud Platform (GCP) `Project`] (https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest/v1/projects) that can have Firebase resources added to it. A Project will only be listed if: - The caller has sufficient [Google IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam) permissions to call AddFirebase. - The Project is not already a FirebaseProject. - The Project is not in an Organization which has policies that prevent Firebase resources from being added. 
*/
await gapi.client.firebase.availableProjects.list({  });

/*
Gets the latest state of a long-running operation. Clients can use this method to poll the operation result at intervals as recommended by the API service.
*/
await gapi.client.firebase.operations.get({ name: "name",  });

/*
Adds Firebase resources to the specified existing [Google Cloud Platform (GCP) `Project`] (https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest/v1/projects). Since a FirebaseProject is actually also a GCP `Project`, a `FirebaseProject` has the same underlying GCP identifiers (`projectNumber` and `projectId`). This allows for easy interop with Google APIs. The result of this call is an [`Operation`](../../v1beta1/operations). Poll the `Operation` to track the provisioning process by calling GetOperation until [`done`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.done) is `true`. When `done` is `true`, the `Operation` has either succeeded or failed. If the `Operation` succeeded, its [`response`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.response) is set to a FirebaseProject; if the `Operation` failed, its [`error`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.error) is set to a google.rpc.Status. The `Operation` is automatically deleted after completion, so there is no need to call DeleteOperation. This method does not modify any billing account information on the underlying GCP `Project`. To call `AddFirebase`, a project member or service account must have the following permissions (the IAM roles of Editor and Owner contain these permissions): `firebase.projects.update`, `resourcemanager.projects.get`, `serviceusage.services.enable`, and `serviceusage.services.get`.
*/
await gapi.client.firebase.projects.addFirebase({ project: "project",  });

/*
Links the specified FirebaseProject with an existing [Google Analytics account](http://www.google.com/analytics/). Using this call, you can either: - Specify an `analyticsAccountId` to provision a new Google Analytics property within the specified account and associate the new property with the `FirebaseProject`. - Specify an existing `analyticsPropertyId` to associate the property with the `FirebaseProject`. Note that when you call `AddGoogleAnalytics`: 1. The first check determines if any existing data streams in the Google Analytics property correspond to any existing Firebase Apps in the `FirebaseProject` (based on the `packageName` or `bundleId` associated with the data stream). Then, as applicable, the data streams and apps are linked. Note that this auto-linking only applies to `AndroidApps` and `IosApps`. 2. If no corresponding data streams are found for the Firebase Apps, new data streams are provisioned in the Google Analytics property for each of the Firebase Apps. Note that a new data stream is always provisioned for a Web App even if it was previously associated with a data stream in the Analytics property. Learn more about the hierarchy and structure of Google Analytics accounts in the [Analytics documentation](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9303323). The result of this call is an [`Operation`](../../v1beta1/operations). Poll the `Operation` to track the provisioning process by calling GetOperation until [`done`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.done) is `true`. When `done` is `true`, the `Operation` has either succeeded or failed. If the `Operation` succeeded, its [`response`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.response) is set to an AnalyticsDetails; if the `Operation` failed, its [`error`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.error) is set to a google.rpc.Status. To call `AddGoogleAnalytics`, a project member must be an Owner for the existing `FirebaseProject` and have the [`Edit` permission](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2884495) for the Google Analytics account. If the `FirebaseProject` already has Google Analytics enabled, and you call `AddGoogleAnalytics` using an `analyticsPropertyId` that's different from the currently associated property, then the call will fail. Analytics may have already been enabled in the Firebase console or by specifying `timeZone` and `regionCode` in the call to [`AddFirebase`](../../v1beta1/projects/addFirebase).
*/
await gapi.client.firebase.projects.addGoogleAnalytics({ parent: "parent",  });

/*
Gets the specified FirebaseProject.
*/
await gapi.client.firebase.projects.get({ name: "name",  });

/*
Gets the configuration artifact associated with the specified FirebaseProject, which can be used by servers to simplify initialization. Typically, this configuration is used with the Firebase Admin SDK [initializeApp](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize_the_sdk) command.
*/
await gapi.client.firebase.projects.getAdminSdkConfig({ name: "name",  });

/*
Gets the Google Analytics details currently associated with the specified FirebaseProject. If the `FirebaseProject` is not yet linked to Google Analytics, then the response to `GetAnalyticsDetails` is `NOT_FOUND`.
*/
await gapi.client.firebase.projects.getAnalyticsDetails({ name: "name",  });

/*
Lists each FirebaseProject accessible to the caller. The elements are returned in no particular order, but they will be a consistent view of the Projects when additional requests are made with a `pageToken`. This method is eventually consistent with Project mutations, which means newly provisioned Projects and recent modifications to existing Projects might not be reflected in the set of Projects. The list will include only ACTIVE Projects. Use GetFirebaseProject for consistent reads as well as for additional Project details.
*/
await gapi.client.firebase.projects.list({  });

/*
Updates the attributes of the specified FirebaseProject. All [query parameters](#query-parameters) are required.
*/
await gapi.client.firebase.projects.patch({ name: "name",  });

/*
Unlinks the specified FirebaseProject from its Google Analytics account. This call removes the association of the specified `FirebaseProject` with its current Google Analytics property. However, this call does not delete the Google Analytics resources, such as the Google Analytics property or any data streams. These resources may be re-associated later to the `FirebaseProject` by calling [`AddGoogleAnalytics`](../../v1beta1/projects/addGoogleAnalytics) and specifying the same `analyticsPropertyId`. For Android Apps and iOS Apps, this call re-links data streams with their corresponding apps. However, for Web Apps, this call provisions a *new* data stream for each Web App. To call `RemoveAnalytics`, a project member must be an Owner for the `FirebaseProject`.
*/
await gapi.client.firebase.projects.removeAnalytics({ parent: "parent",  });

/*
Lists all available Apps for the specified FirebaseProject. This is a convenience method. Typically, interaction with an App should be done using the platform-specific service, but some tool use-cases require a summary of all known Apps (such as for App selector interfaces).
*/
await gapi.client.firebase.projects.searchApps({ parent: "parent",  });
