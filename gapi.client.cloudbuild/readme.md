# TypeScript typings for Cloud Build API v1

Creates and manages builds on Google Cloud Platform.
For detailed description please check [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/).

## Installing

Install typings for Cloud Build API:

```
npm install @types/gapi.client.cloudbuild@v1 --save-dev
```

## Usage

You need to initialize Google API client in your code:

```typescript
gapi.load('client', () => {
  // now we can use gapi.client
  // ...
});
```

Then load api client wrapper:

```typescript
gapi.client.load('cloudbuild', 'v1', () => {
  // now we can use gapi.client.cloudbuild
  // ...
});
```

Don't forget to authenticate your client before sending any request to resources:

```typescript
// declare client_id registered in Google Developers Console
var client_id = '',
  scope = [ 
      // View and manage your data across Google Cloud Platform services
      'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform',
    ],
    immediate = true;
// ...

gapi.auth.authorize(
  { client_id: client_id, scope: scope, immediate: immediate },
  authResult => {
    if (authResult && !authResult.error) {
        /* handle successful authorization */
    } else {
        /* handle authorization error */
    }
});
```

After that you can use Cloud Build API resources:

```typescript

/*
Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation.  The server
makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
guaranteed.  If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
`google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`.  Clients can use
Operations.GetOperation or
other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the
operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation,
the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with
an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1,
corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.
*/
await gapi.client.cloudbuild.operations.cancel({ name: "name",  });

/*
Gets the latest state of a long-running operation.  Clients can use this
method to poll the operation result at intervals as recommended by the API
service.
*/
await gapi.client.cloudbuild.operations.get({ name: "name",  });
```
