             * Creates, updates, or removes resources. This method supports atomic transactions with multiple types of resources. For example, you can atomically create a campaign and a campaign
             * budget, or perform up to thousands of mutates atomically. This method is essentially a wrapper around a series of mutate methods. The only features it offers over calling those
             * methods directly are: - Atomic transactions - Temp resource names (described below) - Somewhat reduced latency over making a series of mutate calls Note: Only resources that support
             * atomic transactions are included, so this method can't replace all calls to individual services. ## Atomic Transaction Benefits Atomicity makes error handling much easier. If you're
             * making a series of changes and one fails, it can leave your account in an inconsistent state. With atomicity, you either reach the chosen state directly, or the request fails and
             * you can retry. ## Temp Resource Names Temp resource names are a special type of resource name used to create a resource and reference that resource in the same request. For example,
             * if a campaign budget is created with `resource_name` equal to `customers/123/campaignBudgets/-1`, that resource name can be reused in the `Campaign.budget` field in the same
             * request. That way, the two resources are created and linked atomically. To create a temp resource name, put a negative number in the part of the name that the server would normally
             * allocate. Note: - Resources must be created with a temp name before the name can be reused. For example, the previous CampaignBudget+Campaign example would fail if the mutate order
             * was reversed. - Temp names are not remembered across requests. - There's no limit to the number of temp names in a request. - Each temp name must use a unique negative number, even
             * if the resource types differ. ## Latency It's important to group mutates by resource type or the request may time out and fail. Latency is roughly equal to a series of calls to
             * individual mutate methods, where each change in resource type is a new call. For example, mutating 10 campaigns then 10 ad groups is like 2 calls, while mutating 1 campaign, 1 ad
             * group, 1 campaign, 1 ad group is like 4 calls. List of thrown errors: [AdCustomizerError]() [AdError]() [AdGroupAdError]() [AdGroupCriterionError]() [AdGroupError]() [AssetError]()
