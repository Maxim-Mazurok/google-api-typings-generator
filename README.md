Generate TypeScript type definitions for all Google APIs,
using [Google API discovery](https://developers.google.com/discovery/) service.

Meant to be used with [Google APIs JavaScript Browser Client](https://github.com/google/google-api-javascript-client), aka `gapi`.
Not to be mistaken with [NodeJS Server Client](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-nodejs-client) which is already in TS; [details](#javascript-vs-nodejs-clients)

## Fork Log:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è This is the only maintained repo for GAPI type definitions (forked and detached from [Bolisov/google-api-typings-generator](https://github.com/Bolisov/google-api-typings-generator))
- ü§ñ Auto updates every hour; [details](#auto-updates)
- Supports both `resource` and second-argument approaches; [details](#resource-vs-body)
- Includes empty interfaces; [details](#empty-interfaces)
- Works for arrays, aka `"repeated": true`; [details](#arrays--repeated-values)
- System proxy support (see [Azure/get-proxy-settings](https://github.com/Azure/get-proxy-settings#system-proxy))
- Other minor fixes and updates

## Usage

### Generating types

1. Use the supported Node version via [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm):

   ```sh
   nvm install
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Generate type definitions for:

   1. all discovered Google APIs:

      ```sh
      npm start
      ```

      _Some APIs are disabled or not fully developed yet, so some expected errors might be output._

   2. one service by name:

      ```sh
      npm start -- --service sheets
      ```

      where `sheets` is the name of the [Google Sheets](https://developers.google.com/sheets/) service.

      _The full list of APIs can be found [here](https://www.googleapis.com/discovery/v1/apis)._

   3. one service by URL:

      ```sh
      npm start -- --url https://sheets.googleapis.com/\\\$discovery/rest?version=v4
      ```

      _Note the intentional escaping of `$discovery`._

### Compiling project

```sh
npm run compile
```

```sh
node dist/cli.js --out ./types
```

### Running tests

Tests are run automatically in practice via GitHub Actions continuous integration.

#### Lint

The generated type definitions are linted via [`dtslint`](https://github.com/Microsoft/dtslint), mimicking
[DefinitelyTyped's process](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped#verifying).

A single project can be linted via:

```sh
npm run dtslint types/<project-directory>
```

All projects can be linted in parallel via:

```sh
GAPI_MAX_PARALLEL=3 npm run lint
```

#### Unit (WIP)

Unit tests for this generator project are written with [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) and
[Mocha](https://mochajs.org/). They can be run via:

```sh
npm run test
```

### Fixing formatting

This project leverages [Google's TypeScript Style (gts)](https://github.com/google/gts) to standardize formatting.

To invoke the automatic code fixer, run:

```sh
npm run fix
```

### Publishing to DefinitelyTypes @types

**Do not publish types to DT directly**

We've [switched](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/49235) to publishing "real" types to npm as `@maxim_mazurok/gapi.client.*` and then referencing them in `@types/gapi.client.*` so that we can release updates automatically and quickly, without using too much human resources of DT.

1. Run this script:

   ```sh
   npx ts-node ./src/dt/cli.ts -o ~/DefinitelyTyped/types
   ```

   , where `~/DefinitelyTyped` is the path to your local clone of [DT repo](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped)

1. Commit to your branch, push to your fork and open PR

## Details

### Auto Updates

Every hour, type definitions are generated, linted, tested and published to NPM.

### Resource VS Body

First approach (Resource):

```javascript
gapi.client.sheets.spreadsheets.batchUpdate({
  spreadsheetId: 'someId',
  resource: {
    // Request Body goes here, as part of `request`
  },
});
```

second approach (Body):

```javascript
gapi.client.sheets.spreadsheets.batchUpdate(
  {
    spreadsheetId: 'someId',
  },
  {
    // Request Body goes here, as a second argument
  }
);
```

Both approaches are valid (tested for Google Sheets API), but first one seems to be default for JS Client Library.

More info here: [google/google-api-javascript-client#432 (comment)](https://github.com/google/google-api-javascript-client/issues/432#issuecomment-530860301),
and here: [declanvong@`bec4f89`#r35992626](https://github.com/declanvong/google-api-typings-generator/commit/bec4f89b998db670e4a9d41810ceb39a1ba9b798#r35992626)

**NOTE:** Some APIs have methods that accept `resource` parameter that is not request body. In that case, we only generate second approach ([details](https://github.com/Maxim-Mazurok/google-api-typings-generator/pull/14/commits/776e36ef25886fdb2d38a002ed12ba1dacde85c5))

### Empty interfaces

This fork keeps interfaces even if they are empty to make typings more accurate.

More info here: [Maxim-Mazurok/google-api-typings-generator#4](https://github.com/Maxim-Mazurok/google-api-typings-generator/pull/4)

### Arrays / repeated values

This fork understands `"repeated": true`

More info here: [Maxim-Mazurok/google-api-typings-generator#1](https://github.com/Maxim-Mazurok/google-api-typings-generator/pull/1)
and here: [declanvong@`bec4f89`#r35992626](https://github.com/declanvong/google-api-typings-generator/commit/bec4f89b998db670e4a9d41810ceb39a1ba9b798#r35992626)

### JavaScript VS NodeJS Clients

There are two ways to use Google APIs: on client-side (in browser) and on server-side.

**Client-side** library, called `gapi` is kinda closed-source.
We can [see](https://apis.google.com/js/api.js) compiled (unreadable minified) JS code of the client-side library.
When you use any Google JS API, you use `gapi`. It loads library definitions from [Google API Discovery Service](https://developers.google.com/discovery)
and generates all API calls on the fly.

So, there's no TS version of `gapi` because it's [closed-source](https://github.com/google/google-api-javascript-client/issues/432#issuecomment-435523106)
and other client libraries do not exist, because they are being generated on the fly by `gapi`.

If you want to use TypeScript with `gapi` - you have to use type definitions generated by this project.
While we do generate typings for Google APIs, we can't generate `gapi` typings from discovery, so we rely on
[@types/gapi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/gapi) and you also should.

**Server-side** libraries are open-sourced and are available [here](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-nodejs-client). Since they are written in TS, you don't need any additional type definitions to use them.

## Troubleshooting

### npm install - 404 Not Found

The error looks like this (see [#483](https://github.com/Maxim-Mazurok/google-api-typings-generator/issues/483)):

```
$ npm install @types/gapi.client.YOUR_API@v2 --save-dev
npm ERR! code E404
npm ERR! 404 Not Found - GET https://registry.npmjs.org/@types%2fgapi.client.YOUR_API - Not found
npm ERR! 404
npm ERR! 404  '@types/gapi.client.YOUR_API@v2' is not in the npm registry.
npm ERR! 404 You should bug the author to publish it (or use the name yourself!)
```

It's most likely caused by your API package not being published to NPM yet.

To fix this - [open an issue](https://github.com/Maxim-Mazurok/google-api-typings-generator/issues/new) and I'll [update](https://github.com/Maxim-Mazurok/google-api-typings-generator/blob/master/bin/apis-sync-helper.ts) the [list of supported APIs](https://github.com/Maxim-Mazurok/google-api-typings-generator/blob/master/bin/auto-publish/config.ts).

Later on, when [#401](https://github.com/Maxim-Mazurok/google-api-typings-generator/issues/401) is closed - this process will be automated.

Also, you can [use these types](https://github.com/Maxim-Mazurok/google-api-typings-generator/issues/85#issuecomment-601133279) from the [types branch](https://github.com/Maxim-Mazurok/google-api-typings-generator/tree/types)
