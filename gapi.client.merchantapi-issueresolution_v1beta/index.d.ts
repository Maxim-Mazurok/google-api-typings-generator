By default, this section contains a `br` tag, that is separating the main text and the tooltip text when the style is not used. * `tooltip-style-question` - the tooltip shows helpful information, can use the '?' as an icon. * `tooltip-style-info` - the tooltip adds additional information fitting to the context, can use the 'i' as an icon. * `content-moderation` - marks the paragraph that explains how the issue was identified. * `new-element` - Present for new elements added to the pre-rendered content in the future.

Example: `local~en~US~sku123` The format of the `{product}` segment in the URL is automatically detected by the server, supporting two options: 1. **Encoded Format**: The `{product}` segment is an unpadded base64url encoded string (RFC 4648 Section 5). The decoded string must result in the `content_language~feed_label~offer_id` structure. This encoding MUST be used if any part of the product identifier (like `offer_id`) contains characters such as `/`, `%`, or `~`. * Example: To represent the product ID `en~US~sku/123`, the `{product}` segment must be the base64url encoding of this string, which is `ZW5-VVMtc2t1LzEyMw`. The full resource name for the product would be `accounts/123/products/ZW5-VVMtc2t1LzEyMw`. 2. **Plain Format**: The `{product}` segment is the tilde-separated string `content_language~feed_label~offer_id`. This format is suitable only when `content_language`, `feed_label`, and `offer_id` do not contain URL-problematic characters like `/`, `%`, or `~`. We recommend using the **Encoded Format** for all product IDs to ensure correct parsing, especially those containing special characters. The presence of tilde (`~`) characters in the `{product}` segment is used to differentiate between the two formats.
