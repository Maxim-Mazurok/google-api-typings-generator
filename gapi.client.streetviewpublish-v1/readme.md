# TypeScript typings for Street View Publish API v1

Publishes 360 photos to Google Maps, along with position, orientation, and connectivity metadata. Apps can offer an interface for positioning, connecting, and uploading user-generated Street View images.
For detailed description please check [documentation](https://developers.google.com/streetview/publish/).

## Installing

Install typings for Street View Publish API:

```
npm install @types/gapi.client.streetviewpublish-v1 --save-dev
```

## Usage

You need to initialize Google API client in your code:

```typescript
gapi.load('client', () => {
  // now we can use gapi.client
  // ...
});
```

Then load api client wrapper:

```typescript
gapi.client.load(
  'https://streetviewpublish.googleapis.com/$discovery/rest?version=v1',
  () => {
    // now we can use:
    // gapi.client.streetviewpublish
  },
);
```

```typescript
// Deprecated, use discovery document URL, see https://github.com/google/google-api-javascript-client/blob/master/docs/reference.md#----gapiclientloadname----version----callback--
gapi.client.load('streetviewpublish', 'v1', () => {
  // now we can use:
  // gapi.client.streetviewpublish
});
```

Don't forget to authenticate your client before sending any request to resources:

```typescript
// declare client_id registered in Google Developers Console
var client_id = '',
  scope = [
    // Publish and manage your 360 photos on Google Street View
    'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/streetviewpublish',
  ],
  immediate = true;
// ...

gapi.auth.authorize(
  {client_id: client_id, scope: scope, immediate: immediate},
  authResult => {
    if (authResult && !authResult.error) {
      /* handle successful authorization */
    } else {
      /* handle authorization error */
    }
  },
);
```

After that you can use Street View Publish API resources: <!-- TODO: make this work for multiple namespaces -->

```typescript
/*
After the client finishes uploading the photo with the returned UploadRef, CreatePhoto publishes the uploaded Photo to Street View on Google Maps. Currently, the only way to set heading, pitch, and roll in CreatePhoto is through the [Photo Sphere XMP metadata](https://developers.google.com/streetview/spherical-metadata) in the photo bytes. CreatePhoto ignores the `pose.heading`, `pose.pitch`, `pose.roll`, `pose.altitude`, and `pose.level` fields in Pose. This method returns the following error codes: * google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT if the request is malformed or if the uploaded photo is not a 360 photo. * google.rpc.Code.NOT_FOUND if the upload reference does not exist. * google.rpc.Code.RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED if the account has reached the storage limit.
*/
await gapi.client.streetviewpublish.photo.create({});

/*
Deletes a Photo and its metadata. This method returns the following error codes: * google.rpc.Code.PERMISSION_DENIED if the requesting user did not create the requested photo. * google.rpc.Code.NOT_FOUND if the photo ID does not exist.
*/
await gapi.client.streetviewpublish.photo.delete({photoId: 'photoId'});

/*
Gets the metadata of the specified Photo. This method returns the following error codes: * google.rpc.Code.PERMISSION_DENIED if the requesting user did not create the requested Photo. * google.rpc.Code.NOT_FOUND if the requested Photo does not exist. * google.rpc.Code.UNAVAILABLE if the requested Photo is still being indexed.
*/
await gapi.client.streetviewpublish.photo.get({photoId: 'photoId'});

/*
Creates an upload session to start uploading photo bytes. The method uses the upload URL of the returned UploadRef to upload the bytes for the Photo. In addition to the photo requirements shown in https://support.google.com/maps/answer/7012050?ref_topic=6275604, the photo must meet the following requirements: * Photo Sphere XMP metadata must be included in the photo metadata. See https://developers.google.com/streetview/spherical-metadata for the required fields. * The pixel size of the photo must meet the size requirements listed in https://support.google.com/maps/answer/7012050?ref_topic=6275604, and the photo must be a full 360 horizontally. After the upload completes, the method uses UploadRef with CreatePhoto to create the Photo object entry.

/*
Updates the metadata of a Photo, such as pose, place association, connections, etc. Changing the pixels of a photo is not supported. Only the fields specified in the updateMask field are used. If `updateMask` is not present, the update applies to all fields. This method returns the following error codes: * google.rpc.Code.PERMISSION_DENIED if the requesting user did not create the requested photo. * google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT if the request is malformed. * google.rpc.Code.NOT_FOUND if the requested photo does not exist. * google.rpc.Code.UNAVAILABLE if the requested Photo is still being indexed.

After the client finishes uploading the PhotoSequence with the returned UploadRef, CreatePhotoSequence extracts a sequence of 360 photos from a video or Extensible Device Metadata (XDM, http://www.xdm.org/) to be published to Street View on Google Maps. `CreatePhotoSequence` returns an Operation, with the PhotoSequence Id set in the `Operation.name` field.
