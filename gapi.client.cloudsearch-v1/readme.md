# TypeScript typings for Cloud Search API v1

Cloud Search provides cloud-based search capabilities over Google Workspace data. The Cloud Search API allows indexing of non-Google Workspace data into Cloud Search.
For detailed description please check [documentation](https://developers.google.com/cloud-search/docs/guides/).

## Installing

Install typings for Cloud Search API:

```
npm install @types/gapi.client.cloudsearch-v1 --save-dev
```

## Usage

You need to initialize Google API client in your code:

```typescript
gapi.load('client', () => {
  // now we can use gapi.client
  // ...
});
```

Then load api client wrapper:

```typescript
gapi.client.load('https://cloudsearch.googleapis.com/$discovery/rest?version=v1', () => {
  // now we can use:
  // gapi.client.cloudsearch
});
```

```typescript
// Deprecated, use discovery document URL, see https://github.com/google/google-api-javascript-client/blob/master/docs/reference.md#----gapiclientloadname----version----callback--
gapi.client.load('cloudsearch', 'v1', () => {
  // now we can use:
  // gapi.client.cloudsearch
});
```

Don't forget to authenticate your client before sending any request to resources:

```typescript
// declare client_id registered in Google Developers Console
var client_id = '',
  scope = [
      // Index and serve your organization's data with Cloud Search
      'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud_search',

      // Index and serve your organization's data with Cloud Search
      'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud_search.debug',

      // Index and serve your organization's data with Cloud Search
      'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud_search.indexing',

      // Search your organization's data in the Cloud Search index
      'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud_search.query',

      // Index and serve your organization's data with Cloud Search
      'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud_search.settings',

      // Index and serve your organization's data with Cloud Search
      'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud_search.settings.indexing',

      // Index and serve your organization's data with Cloud Search
      'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud_search.settings.query',

      // Index and serve your organization's data with Cloud Search
      'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud_search.stats',

      // Index and serve your organization's data with Cloud Search
      'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud_search.stats.indexing',
    ],
    immediate = true;
// ...

gapi.auth.authorize(
  { client_id: client_id, scope: scope, immediate: immediate },
  authResult => {
    if (authResult && !authResult.error) {
        /* handle successful authorization */
    } else {
        /* handle authorization error */
    }
});
```

After that you can use Cloud Search API resources: <!-- TODO: make this work for multiple namespaces -->

```typescript

/*
Uploads media for indexing. The upload endpoint supports direct and resumable upload protocols and is intended for large items that can not be [inlined during index requests](https://developers.google.com/cloud-search/docs/reference/rest/v1/indexing.datasources.items#itemcontent). To index large content: 1. Call indexing.datasources.items.upload with the item name to begin an upload session and retrieve the UploadItemRef. 1. Call media.upload to upload the content, as a streaming request, using the same resource name from the UploadItemRef from step 1. 1. Call indexing.datasources.items.index to index the item. Populate the [ItemContent](/cloud-search/docs/reference/rest/v1/indexing.datasources.items#ItemContent) with the UploadItemRef from step 1. For additional information, see [Create a content connector using the REST API](https://developers.google.com/cloud-search/docs/guides/content-connector#rest). **Note:** This API requires a service account to execute.
*/
await gapi.client.cloudsearch.media.upload({ resourceName: "resourceName",  });

/*
Gets the latest state of a long-running operation. Clients can use this method to poll the operation result at intervals as recommended by the API service.
*/
await gapi.client.cloudsearch.operations.get({ name: "name",  });

/*
Provides functionality to remove logged activity for a user. Currently to be used only for dynamite 1p clients **Note:** This API requires a standard end user account to execute. A service account can't perform Remove Activity requests directly; to use a service account to perform queries, set up [Google Workspace domain-wide delegation of authority](https://developers.google.com/cloud-search/docs/guides/delegation/).
*/
await gapi.client.cloudsearch.query.removeActivity({  });

/*
The Cloud Search Query API provides the search method, which returns the most relevant results from a user query. The results can come from Google Workspace apps, such as Gmail or Google Drive, or they can come from data that you have indexed from a third party. **Note:** This API requires a standard end user account to execute. A service account can't perform Query API requests directly; to use a service account to perform queries, set up [Google Workspace domain-wide delegation of authority](https://developers.google.com/cloud-search/docs/guides/delegation/).
*/
await gapi.client.cloudsearch.query.search({  });

/*
Provides suggestions for autocompleting the query. **Note:** This API requires a standard end user account to execute. A service account can't perform Query API requests directly; to use a service account to perform queries, set up [Google Workspace domain-wide delegation of authority](https://developers.google.com/cloud-search/docs/guides/delegation/).
*/
await gapi.client.cloudsearch.query.suggest({  });

/*
Get customer settings. **Note:** This API requires an admin account to execute.
*/
await gapi.client.cloudsearch.settings.getCustomer({  });

/*
Update customer settings. **Note:** This API requires an admin account to execute.
*/
await gapi.client.cloudsearch.settings.updateCustomer({  });

/*
Gets indexed item statistics aggreggated across all data sources. This API only returns statistics for previous dates; it doesn't return statistics for the current day. **Note:** This API requires a standard end user account to execute.
*/
await gapi.client.cloudsearch.stats.getIndex({  });

/*
Get the query statistics for customer. **Note:** This API requires a standard end user account to execute.
*/
await gapi.client.cloudsearch.stats.getQuery({  });

/*
Get search application stats for customer. **Note:** This API requires a standard end user account to execute.
*/
await gapi.client.cloudsearch.stats.getSearchapplication({  });

/*
Get the # of search sessions, % of successful sessions with a click query statistics for customer. **Note:** This API requires a standard end user account to execute.
*/
await gapi.client.cloudsearch.stats.getSession({  });

/*
Get the users statistics for customer. **Note:** This API requires a standard end user account to execute.
*/
await gapi.client.cloudsearch.stats.getUser({  });

/*
Enables `third party` support in Google Cloud Search. **Note:** This API requires an admin account to execute.
*/
await gapi.client.cloudsearch.initializeCustomer({  });
