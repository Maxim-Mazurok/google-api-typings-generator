             * relative to the new range, e.g. "split at 68%" should be interpreted as "split at 68% of [A, C)". * If the worker chooses to split again using stop_position, only stop_positions in
             * [A, C) will be accepted. * Etc. dynamic_source_split has similar semantics: e.g., if a task with source S splits using dynamic_source_split into {P, R} (where P and R must be
             * together equivalent to S), then subsequent progress and proposed_stop_position should be interpreted relative to P, and in a potential subsequent dynamic_source_split into {P', R'},
             * P' and R' must be together equivalent to P, etc.
