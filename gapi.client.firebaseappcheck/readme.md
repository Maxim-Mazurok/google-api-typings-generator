# TypeScript typings for Firebase App Check API v1beta

App Check works alongside other Firebase services to help protect your backend resources from abuse, such as billing fraud or phishing. With App Check, devices running your app will use an app or device attestation provider that attests to one or both of the following: * Requests originate from your authentic app * Requests originate from an authentic, untampered device This attestation is attached to every request your app makes to your Firebase backend resources. The Firebase App Check REST API allows you to manage your App Check configurations programmatically. It also allows you to exchange attestation material for App Check tokens directly without using a Firebase SDK. Finally, it allows you to obtain the public key set necessary to validate an App Check token yourself. [Learn more about App Check](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-check).
For detailed description please check [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-check).

## Installing

Install typings for Firebase App Check API:

```
npm install @types/gapi.client.firebaseappcheck@v1beta --save-dev
```

## Usage

You need to initialize Google API client in your code:

```typescript
gapi.load('client', () => {
  // now we can use gapi.client
  // ...
});
```

Then load api client wrapper:

```typescript
gapi.client.load('firebaseappcheck', 'v1beta', () => {
  // now we can use gapi.client.firebaseappcheck
  // ...
});
```

Don't forget to authenticate your client before sending any request to resources:

```typescript
// declare client_id registered in Google Developers Console
var client_id = '',
  scope = [ 
      // See, edit, configure, and delete your Google Cloud data and see the email address for your Google Account.
      'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform',

      // View and administer all your Firebase data and settings
      'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/firebase',
    ],
    immediate = true;
// ...

gapi.auth.authorize(
  { client_id: client_id, scope: scope, immediate: immediate },
  authResult => {
    if (authResult && !authResult.error) {
        /* handle successful authorization */
    } else {
        /* handle authorization error */
    }
});
```

After that you can use Firebase App Check API resources:

```typescript

/*
Returns a public JWK set as specified by [RFC 7517](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517) that can be used to verify App Check tokens. Exactly one of the public keys in the returned set will successfully validate any App Check token that is currently valid.
*/
await gapi.client.firebaseappcheck.jwks.get({ name: "name",  });
```
