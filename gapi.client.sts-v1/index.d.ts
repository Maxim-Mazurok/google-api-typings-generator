             * 3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7523#section-3): - `iss`: The issuer of the token. The issuer must provide a discovery document at the URL `/.well-known/openid-configuration`,

             * past. - `exp`: The expiration time, in seconds, since the Unix epoch. Must be less than 48 hours after `iat`. Shorter expiration times are more secure. If possible, we recommend
             * setting an expiration time less than 6 hours. - `sub`: The identity asserted in the JWT. - `aud`: For workload identity pools, this must be a value specified in the allowed
             * audiences for the workload identity pool provider, or one of the audiences allowed by default if no audiences were specified. See
             * https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.workloadIdentityPools.providers#oidc. For workforce pools, this must match the client ID specified in the

             * "additional_claim": "value" } } ``` If `subject_token` is for AWS, it must be a serialized `GetCallerIdentity` token. This token contains the same information as a request to the
             * AWS [`GetCallerIdentity()`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_GetCallerIdentity) method, as well as the AWS
             * [signature](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html) for the request information. Use Signature Version 4. Format the request as URL-encoded
             * JSON, and set the `subject_token_type` parameter to `urn:ietf:params:aws:token-type:aws4_request`. The following parameters are required: - `url`: The URL of the AWS STS endpoint
             * for `GetCallerIdentity()`, such as `https://sts.amazonaws.com?Action=GetCallerIdentity&Version=2011-06-15`. Regional endpoints are also supported. - `method`: The HTTP request
             * method: `POST`. - `headers`: The HTTP request headers, which must include: - `Authorization`: The request signature. - `x-amz-date`: The time you will send the request, formatted as
             * an [ISO8601 Basic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4_elements.html#sigv4_elements_date) string. This value is typically set to the current time and is used to help
             * prevent replay attacks. - `host`: The hostname of the `url` field; for example, `sts.amazonaws.com`. - `x-goog-cloud-target-resource`: The full, canonical resource name of the
             * workload identity pool provider, with or without an `https:` prefix. To help ensure data integrity, we recommend including this header in the `SignedHeaders` field of the signed
             * request. For example: //iam.googleapis.com/projects//locations/global/workloadIdentityPools//providers/
             * https://iam.googleapis.com/projects//locations/global/workloadIdentityPools//providers/ If you are using temporary security credentials provided by AWS, you must also include the
             * header `x-amz-security-token`, with the value set to the session token. The following example shows a `GetCallerIdentity` token: ``` { "headers": [ {"key": "x-amz-date", "value":
             * "20200815T015049Z"}, {"key": "Authorization", "value": "AWS4-HMAC-SHA256+Credential=$credential,+SignedHeaders=host;x-amz-date;x-goog-cloud-target-resource,+Signature=$signature"},
             * {"key": "x-goog-cloud-target-resource", "value": "//iam.googleapis.com/projects//locations/global/workloadIdentityPools//providers/"}, {"key": "host", "value": "sts.amazonaws.com"}
             * . ], "method": "POST", "url": "https://sts.amazonaws.com?Action=GetCallerIdentity&Version=2011-06-15" } ``` If the token is a SAML 2.0 assertion, it must use the format defined in
             * [the SAML 2.0 spec](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/56776/sstc-saml-core-errata-2.0-wd-07.pdf), and the `subject_token_type` must be
