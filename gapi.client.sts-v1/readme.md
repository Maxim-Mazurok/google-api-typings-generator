# TypeScript typings for Security Token Service API v1

The Security Token Service exchanges Google or third-party credentials for a short-lived access token to Google Cloud resources.
For detailed description please check [documentation](http://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation).

## Installing

Install typings for Security Token Service API:

```
npm install @types/gapi.client.sts-v1 --save-dev
```

## Usage

You need to initialize Google API client in your code:

```typescript
gapi.load('client', () => {
  // now we can use gapi.client
  // ...
});
```

Then load api client wrapper:

```typescript
gapi.client.load(
  'https://sts.googleapis.com/$discovery/rest?version=v1',
  () => {
    // now we can use:
    // gapi.client.sts
  }
);
```

```typescript
// Deprecated, use discovery document URL, see https://github.com/google/google-api-javascript-client/blob/master/docs/reference.md#----gapiclientloadname----version----callback--
gapi.client.load('sts', 'v1', () => {
  // now we can use:
  // gapi.client.sts
});
```

After that you can use Security Token Service API resources: <!-- TODO: make this work for multiple namespaces -->

```typescript
/*
Gets information about a Google OAuth 2.0 access token issued by the Google Cloud [Security Token Service API](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/reference/sts/rest).
*/
await gapi.client.sts.introspect({});

/*
Exchanges a credential that represents the resource owner's authorization for a Google-generated [OAuth 2.0 access token] (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-5) or [refreshes an accesstoken] (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-6) following [the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework] (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8693) The credential can be one of the following: - An authorization code issued by the workforce identity federation authorization endpoint - A [refresh token](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-10.4) issued by this endpoint This endpoint is only meant to be called by the Google Cloud CLI. Also note that this API only accepts the authorization code issued for workforce pools.
*/
await gapi.client.sts.oauthtoken({});

/*
Exchanges a credential for a Google OAuth 2.0 access token. The token asserts an external identity within an identity pool, or it applies a Credential Access Boundary to a Google access token. Note that workforce pools do not support Credential Access Boundaries. When you call this method, do not send the `Authorization` HTTP header in the request. This method does not require the `Authorization` header, and using the header can cause the request to fail.
*/
await gapi.client.sts.token({});
```
