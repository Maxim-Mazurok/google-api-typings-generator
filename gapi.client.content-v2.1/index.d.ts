By default, this section contains a `br` tag, that is separating the main text and the tooltip text when the style is not used. * `tooltip-style-question` - the tooltip shows helpful information, can use the '?' as an icon. * `tooltip-style-info` - the tooltip adds additional information fitting to the context, can use the 'i' as an icon. * `content-moderation` - marks the paragraph that explains how the issue was identified. * `new-element` - Present for new elements added to the pre-rendered content in the future.
