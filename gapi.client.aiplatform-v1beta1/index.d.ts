                 * Supported FIELDs for field-restricted queries: * `feature_id` * `description` * `entity_type_id` Examples: * `feature_id: foo` --> Matches a Feature with ID containing the
                 * substring `foo` (eg. `foo`, `foofeature`, `barfoo`). * `feature_id: foo*feature` --> Matches a Feature with ID containing the substring `foo*feature` (eg. `foobarfeature`). *
                 * `feature_id: foo AND description: bar` --> Matches a Feature with ID containing the substring `foo` and description containing the substring `bar`. Besides field queries, the
                 * following exact-match filters are supported. The exact-match filters do not support wildcards. Unlike field-restricted queries, exact-match filters are case-sensitive. *
                 * `feature_id`: Supports = comparisons. * `description`: Supports = comparisons. Multi-token filters should be enclosed in quotes. * `entity_type_id`: Supports = comparisons. *
                 * `value_type`: Supports = and != comparisons. * `labels`: Supports key-value equality as well as key presence. * `featurestore_id`: Supports = comparisons. Examples: *
                 * `description = "foo bar"` --> Any Feature with description exactly equal to `foo bar` * `value_type = DOUBLE` --> Features whose type is DOUBLE. * `labels.active = yes AND
                 * labels.env = prod` --> Features having both (active: yes) and (env: prod) labels. * `labels.env: *` --> Any Feature which has a label with `env` as the key.

                 * `name`, `display_name`, `uri`, `state`, `schema_title`, `create_time`, and `update_time`. Time fields, such as `create_time` and `update_time`, require values specified in
                 * RFC-3339 format. For example: `create_time = "2020-11-19T11:30:00-04:00"` * **Metadata field**: To filter on metadata fields use traversal operation as follows: `metadata..`.
                 * For example: `metadata.field_1.number_value = 10.0` In case the field name contains special characters (such as colon), one can embed it inside double quote. For example:
                 * `metadata."field:1".number_value = 10.0` * **Context based filtering**: To filter Artifacts based on the contexts to which they belong, use the function operator with the full
                 * resource name `in_context()`. For example: `in_context("projects//locations//metadataStores//contexts/")` Each of the above supported filter types can be combined together using
                 * logical operators (`AND` & `OR`). Maximum nested expression depth allowed is 5. For example: `display_name = "test" AND metadata.field1.bool_value = true`.

                 * `display_name`, `uri`, `state`, `schema_title`, `create_time`, and `update_time`. Time fields, such as `create_time` and `update_time`, require values specified in RFC-3339

                 * example: `metadata.field_1.number_value = 10.0` In case the field name contains special characters (such as colon), one can embed it inside double quote. For example:
                 * `metadata."field:1".number_value = 10.0` Each of the above supported filter types can be combined together using logical operators (`AND` & `OR`). Maximum nested expression
                 * depth allowed is 5. For example: `display_name = "test" AND metadata.field1.bool_value = true`.

                 * `display_name`, `schema_title`, `create_time`, and `update_time`. Time fields, such as `create_time` and `update_time`, require values specified in RFC-3339 format. For example:
                 * `create_time = "2020-11-19T11:30:00-04:00"`. * **Metadata field**: To filter on metadata fields use traversal operation as follows: `metadata..`. For example:
                 * `metadata.field_1.number_value = 10.0`. In case the field name contains special characters (such as colon), one can embed it inside double quote. For example:
                 * `metadata."field:1".number_value = 10.0` * **Parent Child filtering**: To filter Contexts based on parent-child relationship use the HAS operator as follows: ```
                 * parent_contexts: "projects//locations//metadataStores//contexts/" child_contexts: "projects//locations//metadataStores//contexts/" ``` Each of the above supported filters can be
                 * combined together using logical operators (`AND` & `OR`). Maximum nested expression depth allowed is 5. For example: `display_name = "test" AND metadata.field1.bool_value =
                 * true`.

                 * example: `create_time = "2020-11-19T11:30:00-04:00"`. * **Metadata field**: To filter on metadata fields use traversal operation as follows: `metadata..` For example:
                 * `metadata.field_1.number_value = 10.0` In case the field name contains special characters (such as colon), one can embed it inside double quote. For example:
                 * `metadata."field:1".number_value = 10.0` * **Context based filtering**: To filter Executions based on the contexts to which they belong use the function operator with the full
                 * resource name: `in_context()`. For example: `in_context("projects//locations//metadataStores//contexts/")` Each of the above supported filters can be combined together using
                 * logical operators (`AND` & `OR`). Maximum nested expression depth allowed is 5. For example: `display_name = "test" AND metadata.field1.bool_value = true`.
