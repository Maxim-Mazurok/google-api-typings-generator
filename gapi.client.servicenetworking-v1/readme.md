# TypeScript typings for Service Networking API v1

Provides automatic management of network configurations necessary for certain services.
For detailed description please check [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure/docs/service-networking/getting-started).

## Installing

Install typings for Service Networking API:

```
npm install @types/gapi.client.servicenetworking-v1 --save-dev
```

## Usage

You need to initialize Google API client in your code:

```typescript
gapi.load('client', () => {
  // now we can use gapi.client
  // ...
});
```

Then load api client wrapper:

```typescript
gapi.client.load('https://servicenetworking.googleapis.com/$discovery/rest?version=v1', () => {
  // now we can use:
  // gapi.client.servicenetworking
});
```

```typescript
// Deprecated, use discovery document URL, see https://github.com/google/google-api-javascript-client/blob/master/docs/reference.md#----gapiclientloadname----version----callback--
gapi.client.load('servicenetworking', 'v1', () => {
  // now we can use:
  // gapi.client.servicenetworking
});
```

Don't forget to authenticate your client before sending any request to resources:

```typescript
// declare client_id registered in Google Developers Console
var client_id = '',
  scope = [
      // See, edit, configure, and delete your Google Cloud data and see the email address for your Google Account.
      'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform',

      // Manage your Google API service configuration
      'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/service.management',
    ],
    immediate = true;
// ...

gapi.auth.authorize(
  { client_id: client_id, scope: scope, immediate: immediate },
  authResult => {
    if (authResult && !authResult.error) {
        /* handle successful authorization */
    } else {
        /* handle authorization error */
    }
});
```

After that you can use Service Networking API resources: <!-- TODO: make this work for multiple namespaces -->

```typescript

/*
Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.
*/
await gapi.client.servicenetworking.operations.cancel({ name: "name",  });

/*
Deletes a long-running operation. This method indicates that the client is no longer interested in the operation result. It does not cancel the operation. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`.
*/
await gapi.client.servicenetworking.operations.delete({ name: "name",  });

/*
Gets the latest state of a long-running operation. Clients can use this method to poll the operation result at intervals as recommended by the API service.
*/
await gapi.client.servicenetworking.operations.get({ name: "name",  });

/*
Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `UNIMPLEMENTED`. NOTE: the `name` binding allows API services to override the binding to use different resource name schemes, such as `users/*/operations`. To override the binding, API services can add a binding such as `"/v1/{name=users/*}/operations"` to their service configuration. For backwards compatibility, the default name includes the operations collection id, however overriding users must ensure the name binding is the parent resource, without the operations collection id.
*/
await gapi.client.servicenetworking.operations.list({ name: "name",  });

/*
For service producers, provisions a new subnet in a peered service's shared VPC network in the requested region and with the requested size that's expressed as a CIDR range (number of leading bits of ipV4 network mask). The method checks against the assigned allocated ranges to find a non-conflicting IP address range. The method will reuse a subnet if subsequent calls contain the same subnet name, region, and prefix length. This method will make producer's tenant project to be a shared VPC service project as needed.
*/
await gapi.client.servicenetworking.services.addSubnetwork({ parent: "parent",  });

/*
Disables VPC service controls for a connection.
*/
await gapi.client.servicenetworking.services.disableVpcServiceControls({ parent: "parent",  });

/*
Enables VPC service controls for a connection.
*/
await gapi.client.servicenetworking.services.enableVpcServiceControls({ parent: "parent",  });

/*
Service producers can use this method to find a currently unused range within consumer allocated ranges. This returned range is not reserved, and not guaranteed to remain unused. It will validate previously provided allocated ranges, find non-conflicting sub-range of requested size (expressed in number of leading bits of ipv4 network mask, as in CIDR range notation).
*/
await gapi.client.servicenetworking.services.searchRange({ parent: "parent",  });

/*
Service producers use this method to validate if the consumer provided network, project and requested range are valid. This allows them to use a fail-fast mechanism for consumer requests, and not have to wait for AddSubnetwork operation completion to determine if user request is invalid.
*/
await gapi.client.servicenetworking.services.validate({ parent: "parent",  });
```
