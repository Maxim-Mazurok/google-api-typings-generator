             * - All of the conversions to calendars should occur in the UTC timezone. We don't typically think of someones birthday changing when they travel, so clients should not use local
             * times. 3. Calendar - The calendar used for the dates should be a Gregorian proleptic calendar. Proleptic means that the rules of the Gregorian calendar are retrofitted to before its
             * adoption. It is easy to get this wrong, particularly with the java GregorianCalendar class, which by default is a mixed Gregorian/Julian calendar. Joda Time makes this easy, but if
             * it's not an option, look into GregorianCalendar.setGregorianChange(). 4. Omitted years - Clients have chosen to represent birthdays or events without years as timestamps within the
             * year zero. When the computed date has a year of 0, it means the client did not specify a year. Note that a year 0 does not exist in a chronology like the familiar Anno Domini (A.D.
             * and B.C.); clients must agree on year numbering. 5. Year Numbering - The chronology used to map dates to the calendar should use Astronomical Year Numbering so that the year 0 is
             * defined and dates before it have a negative year. If libraries only provide Anno Domini, then the year of 1 BC corresponds to year zero and an omitted user provided year. Other BC
             * values are presumed rare, but clients should still not ignore the era and interpret the year as an A.D. value, especially if writing values back to PeopleApi.

             * supposed to be set to 'true' for a rule. Setting both to 'true' at once would lead to undefined behaviour. These 3 modes are: 1. (default) All the support gets assigned to the STBR
             * target. The STBR source is left with no support. To be extra sure, interpretations that still managed to get triggered by STBR source are suppressed later unless STBR target has no

             * target. That allows both STBR source and STBR target to trigger some intents with KScorer later deciding which intent is better. In other words, this is "when it is not clear
             * whether a query is about France of Louis XIV, provide KScorer with both options and let it decide". For this mode mentions_only should be set to 'false' and support_share should be
             * set to 'true'. 3. While annotations for the STBR target are created, no support is given to those annotations. This is more like "we are mostly sure that a mention of France is
             * about the country, but just for a rare case it is about the monarch, we would like to have Louis XIV annotated". For this mode mentions_only should be set to 'true' and
