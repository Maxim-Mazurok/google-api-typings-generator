# TypeScript typings for Binary Authorization API v1beta1

The management interface for Binary Authorization, a service that provides policy-based deployment validation and control for images deployed to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Anthos Service Mesh, Anthos Clusters, and Cloud Run.
For detailed description please check [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/binary-authorization/).

## Installing

Install typings for Binary Authorization API:

```
npm install @types/gapi.client.binaryauthorization-v1beta1 --save-dev
```

## Usage

You need to initialize Google API client in your code:

```typescript
gapi.load('client', () => {
  // now we can use gapi.client
  // ...
});
```

Then load api client wrapper:

```typescript
gapi.client.load(
  'https://binaryauthorization.googleapis.com/$discovery/rest?version=v1beta1',
  () => {
    // now we can use:
    // gapi.client.binaryauthorization
  },
);
```

```typescript
// Deprecated, use discovery document URL, see https://github.com/google/google-api-javascript-client/blob/master/docs/reference.md#----gapiclientloadname----version----callback--
gapi.client.load('binaryauthorization', 'v1beta1', () => {
  // now we can use:
  // gapi.client.binaryauthorization
});
```

Don't forget to authenticate your client before sending any request to resources:

```typescript
// declare client_id registered in Google Developers Console
var client_id = '',
  scope = [
    // See, edit, configure, and delete your Google Cloud data and see the email address for your Google Account.
    'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform',
  ],
  immediate = true;
// ...

gapi.auth.authorize(
  {client_id: client_id, scope: scope, immediate: immediate},
  authResult => {
    if (authResult && !authResult.error) {
      /* handle successful authorization */
    } else {
      /* handle authorization error */
    }
  },
);
```

After that you can use Binary Authorization API resources: <!-- TODO: make this work for multiple namespaces -->

```typescript
/*
A policy specifies the attestors that must attest to a container image, before the project is allowed to deploy that image. There is at most one policy per project. All image admission requests are permitted if a project has no policy. Gets the policy for this project. Returns a default policy if the project does not have one.
*/
await gapi.client.binaryauthorization.projects.getPolicy({name: 'name'});

/*
Creates or updates a project's policy, and returns a copy of the new policy. A policy is always updated as a whole, to avoid race conditions with concurrent policy enforcement (or management!) requests. Returns NOT_FOUND if the project does not exist, INVALID_ARGUMENT if the request is malformed.
*/
await gapi.client.binaryauthorization.projects.updatePolicy({name: 'name'});

/*
Gets the current system policy in the specified location.
*/
await gapi.client.binaryauthorization.systempolicy.getPolicy({name: 'name'});
```
