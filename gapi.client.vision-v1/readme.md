# TypeScript typings for Cloud Vision API v1

Integrates Google Vision features, including image labeling, face, logo, and landmark detection, optical character recognition (OCR), and detection of explicit content, into applications.
For detailed description please check [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vision/).

## Installing

Install typings for Cloud Vision API:

```
npm install @types/gapi.client.vision-v1 --save-dev
```

## Usage

You need to initialize Google API client in your code:

```typescript
gapi.load('client', () => {
  // now we can use gapi.client
  // ...
});
```

Then load api client wrapper:

```typescript
gapi.client.load('https://vision.googleapis.com/$discovery/rest?version=v1', () => {
  // now we can use:
  // gapi.client.vision
});
```

```typescript
// Deprecated, use discovery document URL, see https://github.com/google/google-api-javascript-client/blob/master/docs/reference.md#----gapiclientloadname----version----callback--
gapi.client.load('vision', 'v1', () => {
  // now we can use:
  // gapi.client.vision
});
```

Don't forget to authenticate your client before sending any request to resources:

```typescript
// declare client_id registered in Google Developers Console
var client_id = '',
  scope = [
      // See, edit, configure, and delete your Google Cloud data and see the email address for your Google Account.
      'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform',

      // Apply machine learning models to understand and label images
      'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-vision',
    ],
    immediate = true;
// ...

gapi.auth.authorize(
  { client_id: client_id, scope: scope, immediate: immediate },
  authResult => {
    if (authResult && !authResult.error) {
        /* handle successful authorization */
    } else {
        /* handle authorization error */
    }
});
```

After that you can use Cloud Vision API resources: <!-- TODO: make this work for multiple namespaces -->

```typescript

/*
Service that performs image detection and annotation for a batch of files. Now only "application/pdf", "image/tiff" and "image/gif" are supported. This service will extract at most 5 (customers can specify which 5 in AnnotateFileRequest.pages) frames (gif) or pages (pdf or tiff) from each file provided and perform detection and annotation for each image extracted.
*/
await gapi.client.vision.files.annotate({  });

/*
Run asynchronous image detection and annotation for a list of generic files, such as PDF files, which may contain multiple pages and multiple images per page. Progress and results can be retrieved through the `google.longrunning.Operations` interface. `Operation.metadata` contains `OperationMetadata` (metadata). `Operation.response` contains `AsyncBatchAnnotateFilesResponse` (results).
*/
await gapi.client.vision.files.asyncBatchAnnotate({  });

/*
Run image detection and annotation for a batch of images.
*/
await gapi.client.vision.images.annotate({  });

/*
Run asynchronous image detection and annotation for a list of images. Progress and results can be retrieved through the `google.longrunning.Operations` interface. `Operation.metadata` contains `OperationMetadata` (metadata). `Operation.response` contains `AsyncBatchAnnotateImagesResponse` (results). This service will write image annotation outputs to json files in customer GCS bucket, each json file containing BatchAnnotateImagesResponse proto.
*/
await gapi.client.vision.images.asyncBatchAnnotate({  });

/*
Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.
*/
await gapi.client.vision.operations.cancel({ name: "name",  });

/*
Deletes a long-running operation. This method indicates that the client is no longer interested in the operation result. It does not cancel the operation. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`.
*/
await gapi.client.vision.operations.delete({ name: "name",  });

/*
Gets the latest state of a long-running operation. Clients can use this method to poll the operation result at intervals as recommended by the API service.
*/
await gapi.client.vision.operations.get({ name: "name",  });

/*
Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `UNIMPLEMENTED`. NOTE: the `name` binding allows API services to override the binding to use different resource name schemes, such as `users/*/operations`. To override the binding, API services can add a binding such as `"/v1/{name=users/*}/operations"` to their service configuration. For backwards compatibility, the default name includes the operations collection id, however overriding users must ensure the name binding is the parent resource, without the operations collection id.
*/
await gapi.client.vision.operations.list({ name: "name",  });
```
